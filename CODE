#1. Loading and Preping the Data 
a. Go to the Power Query sub-section and make sure that Ship Date and Order Date are both date type. 
b. Remove unnecessary columns like ProductID for less cluttering. 


#2. Creating KPI measures
a. In the Modeling tab, we go to New Measure and add the following ones:
Total Sales = SUM(Sample - Superstore['Sales'])
Total Profit = SUM('Sample - Superstore'[Profit])
Sales Growth % = DIVIDE([Total Sales] - [Sales LY], [Sales LY])
Profit LY = CALCULATE([Total Profit], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Calendar'[Date]))
Profit Growth % = DIVIDE([Total Profit] - [Profit LY], [Profit LY])
